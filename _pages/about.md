I am a graduate from Miami University, in Oxford, Ohio. I have studied Statistics with a Business Analytics minor.
<br>
<br>
Previously, I was a data visualization intern in the IT service center at Miami University for a year. I have created user-friendly interactive dashboards for incident management, project management, and process performance, using live datasets. These were referred to report to executive members in the department for weekly and monthly basis.
<br>
<br>
I believe that fully understanding and being familiar with datasets before starting data analysis is the most important part in order to deliver reliable insights. With a full understanding of the data, I cleanse, manipulate, analyze, and visualize the data with various types of software.
<br>
<br>
I am a person who finds values from small things such as donating a few dollars can save many lives of children living in a poor environment in Africa. I find happiness from the values and sharing them to others.
<br>
<br>
My dream is to become a data scientist who positively influences others with values and insights found from flowing data in the world.
