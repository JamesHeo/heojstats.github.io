## Introduction
New York City is one of the most popular and famous city in the US. When a person visits the US, it might be a must place to go. It indicates that since there is a lot of travelers in the city, there must be high number of taxis in the city. In this project, it simply shows the trend of taxi trips: number of trips and taxi duration. It is built in shiny application format which gives users an ability to choose pick up and drop off locations along with month and day of the week.
